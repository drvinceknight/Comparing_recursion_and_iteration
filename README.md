# Comparing Recursion and Iterative Algorithms

Repo for a [blog post](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/im-in-middle-of-putting-together-new.html) comparing recursive and iterative implementations of binary search and factorial algorithms.

# Contents

There are two pairs of python scripts: Compare_[Binary/Factorial].py and Analyse_[Binary/Factorial].py. The first runs a comparison of either a binary search of factorial algorithm outputting some data:

- iterativebinarysearch.csv
- recursivebinarysearch.csv
- factorial.csv

Subsequently the analysis scripts can be used to obtain the plots shown in [this blog post](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/im-in-middle-of-putting-together-new.html). There is also a makefile that will just run the analysis script required based on a change to the correct csv file.

**Note** currently the binary algorithm analysis takes a while (there's a bunch of data)...
